`Because I got annoyed at Discord's mobile app for using too much bandwidth`
This is a fun project meant to interact with DMs whilst from the terminal, trying to encompass as many features as I could reasonably fit and make work.
The TODO list for this project is long, and I may abandon it for no reason.

Usage:
Throw your { "token": "..." } in the config.json file, install the package.json dependencies, and run it with NodeJS.
Mostly meant to be used when SSHing to another pc and firing it up there, then only plaintext data will be sent across the metered cellular network, saving lots of bandwidth.
