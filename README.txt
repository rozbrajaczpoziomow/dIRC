`Because I got annoyed at Discord's mobile app for using too much bandwidth`
This is a fun project meant to interact with DMs whilst from the terminal, trying to encompass as many features as I could reasonably fit and make work.
The TODO list for this project is long, and I may abandon it for no reason.

Usage:
Rename config.json.example to config.json and change out the token and other values you might find (like debug). Install the dependencies from package.json, and run it with NodeJS.
Mostly meant to be used when SSHing to another pc and starting it up there, then only needed plaintext data will be sent across network, saving bandwidth.
